### Introduction
$ Fire detection is a critical aspect of ensuring the safety of environments such as buildings, factories, and public spaces. This machine learning model employs the XGBoost algorithm to analyze sensor readings and determine if there is a potential fire hazard.

Requirements
* Python 3.x
* XGBoost
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib (for visualization)
* Installation


$ Data Collection: Gather sensor readings data. Ensure that the data includes features relevant to fire detection.

$ Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing as necessary.

$ Model Training: Train the XGBoost model using the provided script or your own implementation.

$ Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

$ Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions on new sensor readings and trigger alarms accordingly.
